Bug related to the implementation of preprocessing:

- JoinReader joins blackslash-newline sequences, but does not correctly update
  line numbers in this case. This affects for instance the output of __LINE__.
- include MACRO() does not always work
- alternative macros with different argument count currently do not work;
- #if in macro arguments is not correctly processed if 'if' is a macro, at least
  in some cases, because 'if' is expanded - in the Linux kernel, if conditional
  replacement of if statement is not forbidden, the preprocessor will therefore
  enter an infinite loop.
- XXX continue
